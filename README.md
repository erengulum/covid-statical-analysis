# Statistical Analysis of COVID-19 Epidemic

COVID-19, which started recently, is about to become the most dangerous disease in the world. Due to the virus spreading all over the world from China, a pandemic was declared about a month ago.  The virus, which currently has no vaccine or effective treatment, is becoming more and more dangerous. In this project, our aim is to examine the spread of the virus with different methods, to achieve some results and to better understand the spread mechanism of the virus. During the project; We will work on datasets containing virus spread areas, spread rate, mortality rate and other factors.

# Our project will basically consist of three different parts: 

In the first part, we will try to find the real reasons behind the mortality rates. 

In the second part of the project, the full quarantine situation, the semi-quarantine situation (social distance) and the Free-movement situations will be examined. In these three different cases, the spread rates of the virus will be determined. 

In the third part, the report published by the Italian doctors will be examined. Then, we will try to predict total cases and total deaths of the countries by using different machine learning models.

Project is divided into three different parts, so we created a table of contents for three different sections.
